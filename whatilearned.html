    <h1>My 22-23 school year</h1>
    <h2>Intro to software </h2>
 <p id="software">In this class I learned alot of things and we learned some things from testout and we studied for the ITF+ certification test. We also learned about virtual machines and how they work and what they do. Finally another thing we did in the class was practice labs and that was another form of studying but it is hands on</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p id="hardware">In hardware we started off with learning what bianary is ad how to convert it into hexadecimal and the other way around. We then shifted into learining a bunch of computer parts and how they work and what they do. Lastly we did some lab work we we went into our book and ansewred the questions by doing the prosedure that we were told to do</p>
<h4>Intro To Networking</h4>
<p id="Networking">In this class we learned what a network is and we did alot of studying for the ITF+ exam because we were going to take it really soon at that point. so that was the majority of that class  </p>
<h5>Intro to programming </h5>
<p id="Programming">In this class we learned what style css, html and javascript codeing launguages. We also learned and used RPG maker MV and we made our own game and completed challenges throughout the course of the class and this is my final shop class of he year and I will take all 4 of theses next year. But for my 11th and 12th grade year I will specilize in one of them and stay there until I graduate  </p>
